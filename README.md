## **Installation**

After forking and/or cloning the repo run the command `npm install`. To start the server run the command `npm start`.  To open the application locally use the address `http://localhost:3001`  or if you have **[heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)** installed, use the command `heroku open` to open the application.

## **Usage**

Once the application is open, it is very straightforward to use.  Simply add a Note Title and Note body and click on the disk icon to save your note.  Saved notes will be displayed in the the left side column on the screen.  These notes can be erased but will otherwise automatically save to the server.  Enjoy!
